# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Introduction

This project is part of The [Udacity](https://eu.udacity.com/) Data Scientist Nanodegree Program which is composed by:
* Term 1
    * Supervised Learning
    * Deep Learning
    * Unsupervised Learning
* Term 2
    * Write A Data Science Blog Post
    * Disaster Response Pipelines
    * Recommendation Engines

The goal of this project is to apply the data engineering skills learned in the course to analyze disaster data from [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/) to build a model for an API that classifies disaster messages. The project is divided in three sections:
* **Data Processing**: build an ETL(Extract, Transform, and Load) Pipeline to extract data from the given dataset, clean the data, and then store it in a SQLite database
* **Machine Learning Pipeline**: split the data into a training set and a test set. Then, create a machine learning pipeline that uses NLTK, as well as scikit-learn's Pipeline and GridSearchCV to output a final model that predicts a message classifications for the 36 categories (multi-output classification)
* **Web development** develop a web application to show classify messages in real time

## Software and Libraries

This project uses Python 3.7.2 and the following libraries:
* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
* [nltk](https://www.nltk.org/)
* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* [sqlalchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
* [dash](https://plot.ly/dash/)

## Data

The dataset is provided by [Figure Eight](https://www.figure-eight.com/dataset/combined-disaster-response-data/) is basically composed by:
* **disaster_categories.csv**: Categories of the messages
* **disaster_messages.csv**: Multilingual disaster response messages
